						In 1974, Montana did something that stunned anglers across the state and the nation: It stopped stocking trout in streams and rivers that supported wild trout populations.
						<br><br>
						The move initially outraged many anglers, fishing businesses, and even some Montana Fish and Game Department staff. For decades, hatcheries had been credited with producing more and better fishing. Without stocking, many Montanans asked, what would happen to the state’s famous trout waters and the businesses that relied on legions of anglers arriving from across the country each summer?
						<br><br>
						The answer, now well known, is that trout fishing improved dramatically. Once stocking was discontinued, wild trout numbers doubled, tripled, and more on many rivers.
						<br><br>
						“This eviction notice affects all sports fisheries on the Skeena River and tributaries, all forest activities … and CN Rail,” declared the Gitxsan. “All are expected to vacate and cease activities on Aug. 4, 2014 until both Crowns have obtained the required consent of the Gitxsan Hereditary Chiefs.”    <a class="readmore" href="#article1">READ MORE>></a>
